I made schrel because I was sick of wrong and incomplete information in real estate listings while searching for an apartement. It basically acts as a specification for serious realtors and as a kind of "test" for **you** to see if a listing follows that. Say no to misleading titles, exaggerated area or understated costs and incomplete information about appointments.
